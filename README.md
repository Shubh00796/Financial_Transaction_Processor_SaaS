# 💸 Financial Transaction Processor SaaS

An **enterprise-grade financial transaction processing system** built for **high-frequency trading**, **digital payments**, and **real-time settlements**. Designed with precision, modularity, and performance in mind — this backend powerhouse leverages **Spring Boot**, **event-driven design**, and **clean architecture** to orchestrate secure and scalable financial operations.

## 🔄 Transaction Lifecycle (Event-Driven Flow)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Transaction Initiated] --> B[Validation & Authorization]
    B --> C[Funds Reserved]
    C --> D[Settlement Triggered]
    D --> E[Transaction Completed]
```

Each stage is orchestrated using **domain events**, enabling asynchronous processing and fault-tolerant workflows.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ⚡ **High-Frequency Trading Support** — optimized for rapid transaction throughput
- 🔐 **Secure Digital Payments** — robust validation and exception handling
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Settlement** — immediate finality with event-driven triggers
- 🧩 **Modular Design** — clean separation of controllers, services, and repositories
- 📊 **Domain-Driven Events** — scalable and decoupled transaction orchestration
- 🧪 **Validation & Exception Handling** — custom validators and global error responses

## 🐳 Docker Integration (Coming Soon)

Docker support is on the roadmap to enable:

- ✅ Containerized deployment
- 🔁 Environment consistency across dev/staging/prod
- 🚀 Easy onboarding for contributors

### Sample Dockerfile (to be added)

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
COPY target/FinancialTransactionProcessor.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

This isn’t just another backend — it’s a **financial-grade transaction engine** built with the rigor of production systems. Whether you're simulating high-frequency trades or orchestrating real-time payments, this platform is engineered to scale, secure, and succeed.
